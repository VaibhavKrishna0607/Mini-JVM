1. Main.java:

We're simulating bytecode as a simple array of strings.
• 	The  class will interpret each instruction.
• 	This keeps things readable and avoids needing a full  parser.
Let me know when you're ready, and we’ll scaffold  next — starting with a basic interpreter loop and a stack-based execution model. We’ll keep it intuitive and extensible.
